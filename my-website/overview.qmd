## Introduction
Bangkok is rapidly urbanizing, and with this growth comes the challenge of balancing development with environmental sustainability. This project uses high-resolution satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 (or Landsat 8) between 2020 and 2024 to detect land cover changes in Bangkok, with a special focus on green spaces.

By leveraging remote sensing and GIS techniques, this study provides a data-driven view of how Bangkok's landscape has evolved over five years, supporting the assessment of urban development trends in relation to the city's Green Bangkok 2030 goals.



## Objectives

- To classify major land cover types in Bangkok annually from 2020 to 2024.
- To quantify the spatial and temporal changes in green spaces and built-up areas.
- To visualize land cover transitions and detect urban expansion patterns.
- To evaluate how these changes align with the Green Bangkok 2030 initiative.


## Tools & Data

- Satellite Imagery: Sentinel-2 / Landsat 8 (2020â€“2024)
- GIS Software: QGIS
- Methods: Supervised classification, NDVI analysis, change detection


## Why It Matters

The results of this project can inform urban planners, policymakers, and researchers about the pace and patterns of land cover change in Bangkok. With green space being a vital component of urban resilience and public health, tracking its progression is critical to shaping a sustainable future for the city.
