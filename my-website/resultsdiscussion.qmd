### 4.1 Increase in Greenery in Bangkok
 
Bangkok's overall greenery increased between 2021 and 2025. NDVI analysis shows clear gains in vegetation cover, especially in outlying areas. The urban tree canopy ratio rose from 16.6% to 19%, and green space per person increased from 6 sqm to 25 sqm, exceeding the 2030 target of 10 sqm/person.

### 4.2 Decrease in Greenery Density
 
Despite more green cover, the density of greenery has declined in central districts. Formerly green-rich zones (e.g., CBD areas like Chong Nonsi) have been urbanized. Green areas are now more spread out and less clustered, reducing ecological value and limiting multifunctional use.

### 4.3 Accessibility to Green Spaces Remains Low
 
Despite increases in total greenery, walkable access to public green space remains poor. Only 25.1% of Bangkokâ€™s land is within 400m of large, publicly accessible green areas, far below the 2030 target of 50%. Accessibility improved only marginally (+3%) from 2021.

### 4.4 Inaccessible Green Space
 
Many green zones are private or reserved for future development, contributing to inflated coverage stats without providing actual public benefit.

### Plans for the Future

To build on the progress made, future urban greening in Bangkok should prioritize not just expanding green cover but improving its quality, accessibility, and integration into the urban fabric:

- **Enhance Inner-City Integration**: Focus on increasing green space within central districts through vertical gardens, rooftop greenery, and pocket parks to counteract urban heat and fragmentation.
- **Restore Green Density**: Introduce incentives for high-density developments to incorporate multifunctional green infrastructure and maintain ecological connectivity.
- **Improve Accessibility**: Develop green spaces in underserved neighborhoods and increase proximity to public parks through strategic urban design, ensuring equitable access for all residents.
- **Audit and Unlock Private Green Areas**: Launch accessibility audits and explore frameworks that open private or restricted green areas for public use through community partnerships or shared space schemes.
