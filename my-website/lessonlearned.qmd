title: "Lesson Learnt"

This project was an eye-opening experience for our team, as it allowed us to apply remote sensing and GIS techniques to analyze real-world land cover changes in a dynamic urban environment like Bangkok. More importantly, the project helped us to reconcile our in-class learnings with real world applications. In particular, using GIS to track Bangkok's progress towards its 2030 Green Plan meant that we could quantifiably prove whether official statistics were correct, which is especially important for any policy - related work. Working with multi-temporal satellite data enhanced our understanding of how spatial technologies can be leveraged to track urban expansion, green space loss, and environmental trends over time.

One of the most important lessons we learned was the **value of data-driven urban planning**. Through this project, we saw firsthand how geospatial tools can support cities in monitoring progress toward sustainability goals such as the **Green Bangkok 2030** initiative. Rather than relying on numbers in a spreadsheet, we were able to identify exact changes in green space cover down to the neighbourhood level. The value this had over pure numbers was our ability to identify visually changes in greenery, which would not be available if we performed a spreadsheet analysis. For example, while the green cover in Bangkok did increase, using our satellite imagery and Google Maps streetview, we could identify not only an increase in fragmentation of green spaces, but the prevalence of inaccessible greenery. For example, most green plots are either land earmarked for development or situated in private property like hotels. Both of these green spaces would be unavailable to the public, highlighting that whilst the actual number and area of green spaces might have increased, actual public access to greenery might have actually decreased - something which pure numbers would never be able to reveal. 

While technical challenges such as image preprocessing, classification accuracy, and cloud cover presented learning curves, they taught us the importance of methodological rigor and spatial thinking in GIS workflows. The documentation and meeting minutes techniques enforced in the rubrics and our previous projects proved particularly important because we split the work into a preparation and analysis phase, with each of us handling the one phase completely by ourselves. This meant the need for proper hand-over / take-over techniques as well as consistency in our data analysis techniques. Whilst there were hiccups, we used these experiences as learning opportunities to improve the quality of our discussions and work to improve the GIS research process. 

Most importantly, this project reinforced the idea that **GIS is more than just a tool — it’s a way to contribute to positive, real-world change**. Whether it's monitoring deforestation, guiding green infrastructure planning, or supporting disaster preparedness, spatial analysis holds the potential to shape better cities and a more sustainable future.
