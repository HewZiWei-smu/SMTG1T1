title: "Lesson Learnt"

This project was an eye-opening experience for our team, as it allowed us to apply remote sensing and GIS techniques to analyze real-world land cover changes in a dynamic urban environment like Bangkok. Working with multi-temporal satellite data enhanced our understanding of how spatial technologies can be leveraged to track urban expansion, green space loss, and environmental trends over time.

One of the most important lessons we learned was the **value of data-driven urban planning**. Through this project, we saw firsthand how geospatial tools can support cities in monitoring progress toward sustainability goals such as the **Green Bangkok 2030** initiative. It also emphasized the importance of maintaining and expanding green spaces in rapidly urbanizing cities, not just for aesthetics, but for climate resilience, public health, and quality of life.

While technical challenges such as image preprocessing, classification accuracy, and cloud cover presented learning curves, they taught us the importance of methodological rigor and spatial thinking in GIS workflows.

Most importantly, this project reinforced the idea that **GIS is more than just a tool — it’s a way to contribute to positive, real-world change**. Whether it's monitoring deforestation, guiding green infrastructure planning, or supporting disaster preparedness, spatial analysis holds the potential to shape better cities and a more sustainable future.
