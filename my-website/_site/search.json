    "text": "Finding: Bangkok’s overall greenery increased between 2021 and 2025. NDVI analysis shows clear gains in vegetation cover, especially in outlying areas. The urban tree canopy ratio rose from 16.6% to 19%, and green space per person increased from 6 sqm to 25 sqm, exceeding the 2030 target of 10 sqm/person.\nRecommendation: While this progress is encouraging, it is not enough to focus on quantity alone. The city should ensure green spaces are integrated into inner-city areas to prevent habitat fragmentation and maximize urban cooling and ecosystem benefits.\n\n\n\nFinding: Despite more green cover, the density of greenery has declined in central districts. Formerly green-rich zones (e.g., CBD areas like Chong Nonsi) have been urbanized. Green areas are now more spread out and less clustered, reducing ecological value and limiting multifunctional use.\nRecommendation: Implement urban greening strategies in dense zones (e.g., pocket parks, rooftop gardens, vertical greening) to restore density where large parks are not feasible. Encourage developers to integrate green infrastructure into high-density projects.\n\n\n\nFinding: Despite increases in total greenery, walkable access to public green space remains poor. Only 25.1% of Bangkok’s land is within 400m of large, publicly accessible green areas, far below the 2030 target of 50%. Accessibility improved only marginally (+3%) from 2021.\nRecommendation: Prioritize green space development in under-served neighborhoods, and explore converting underutilized or fenced-off green lots into public parks. Future greenery planning must focus on distribution and public access, not just expansion.\n\n\n\nFinding: Many green zones are private or reserved for future development, contributing to inflated coverage stats without providing actual public benefit.\nRecommendation: Conduct public accessibility audits and introduce policies that incentivize converting private greenery into shared community spaces (e.g., public-private park partnerships, open garden schemes)."

    "text": "PREPARATION PROCEDURES\n\n1.0.1 Data Preparation\nGoal: To download and prepare data 1. Download Copernicus data:\nOn the Copernicus portal, select Copernicus L2A data for the Bangkok region. The filtering criteria would be &lt;5% cloud cover, and between January - March of 2020 and 2025. \n\nDownload Bangkok GIS data:\nObtain the GeoJSON of the Bangkok Administrative Area\n\n\n\n1.0.2 Data Loading\n\nLoad the Copernicus datasets into QGIS.\nOnly load the B02, B03, B04, B08 layers for 2021 and 2025. Rename them according to the convention “B0[]_202[]“” and group them by year into groups.\nLoad the Bangkok GeoJSON into QGIS.\nAfter loading, select attributes by Administrative Region = Bangkok. Save the selected attributes into a new layer, “Bangkok” and use it in place of the full layer.\n\n\n\n1.1.0 Data exploration\n\nBand Set creation\nFor each year, create a new band set. Ensure the bands are in ascending order. After which, use the SCP plugin to use 4 - 3 - 2 False Color Composite and save the band set by year. This will help us easily identify vegeration from the raster data.\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) layers\nCreate NDVI layers for each year by using the raster calculator using the formula (B08 - B04) / (B08 + B04). Save the layer after checking. Once both years’ layers are created, created a difference layer using the formula (2025 NDVI - 2021 NDVI) to identify change in NDVI.\n\n\n\n2.0.1 Areas of Interest\n\nClip all raster layers to the Bangkok vector\nWithin the Bangkok region, bookmark the residential area of Lat Phrao and the CBD area of Chong Nonsi for further detailed analysis.\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Increasing ratio of green spaces\nGoal: To determine whether Bangkok meets the target of 10 square meters of green space per person by comparing green space areas and population data between 2021 and 2025.\n\nPrepare Data for Area Calculation:\nThe clipped green space layers for both 2021 and 2025 were projected to EPSG:32647 (UTM Zone 47N) to ensure accurate area calculations in square meters.\nCalculate Green Space Area:\nThe Field Calculator was used to create a new field named area using the expression:\n$area\nThis calculated the area of each polygon feature in square meters.\nSelect Public Green Spaces:\nThe Select Features by Expression tool was used to isolate only green space features classified as public.\nThe following expression was applied:\n“2025_Vectored_Green” = 1\nCompute Total Green Space Area:\nThe Statistics Panel was used to sum the values in the area field for the selected features.\nThe total green space areas were:\n 2025: 484,421,000 m² (484.421 km²)\n\n 2021: 437,733,000 m² (437.733 km²)\nCalculate Net Change in Green Space:\nThe difference between the two years was calculated:\n Increase: 46.688 km² of green space from 2021 to 2025\nObtain Population Data:\nAccording to Macrotrends (n.d.), the population of Bangkok was:\n 2021: 10,723,000 people\n\n 2025: 11,392,000 people\nCalculate Green Space Per Person (GSPP):\nThe formula used:\nGSPP = Total Green Space Area (m²) / Population\nResults:\n 2021 GSPP: 40.8 sqm/person \n ​\n 2025 GSPP: 42.5 sqm/person\nConclusion:\nBoth years’ calculations exceed the minimum target of 10 sqm per person, with a modest increase of 1.7 sqm/person from 2021 to 2025.\nThis would indicates positive progress in enhancing urban green space access in Bangkok. However, this differs significantly from the publicly available data of 6sqm per person in 2021 and 7.3 sqm per person in 2025. We believe this to be differences in urban boundary establishment and / or differences in population statistics, to which we were unable to find official sources to determine the geographical boundary or population number to calculate from. Nevertheless, both the official and our calculated statistic reflects a growing urban greenery area in Bangkok.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Increasing public green spaces\nApplying an Area Threshold\nTo ensure meaningful analysis of publicly accessible green spaces, an area threshold of 10,000 m² (1 hectare) was applied. This step filters out minor vegetation features such as street medians, roadside trees, and small decorative patches, which are unlikely to serve as formal public parks or recreational areas.\nExpression used in QGIS:\n“2021_Vectored_Gr” = 1 AND “area” &gt; 10000\nThis refinement:\nRetains only green features larger than 10,000 m²\nLikely captures significant green zones such as public parks and urban forests\nEliminates smaller, non-functional or inaccessible green patches\nThe resulting dataset allows for a more realistic assessment of green space accessibility.\n2021 Analysis: In 2021, filtered features from the “Clipped Natural Greenery 2021” layer were buffered using a 400-meter radius to represent walkable access to green areas. The output was dissolved to prevent overlap inflation and clipped to Bangkok’s administrative boundary.\nBuffered Area: 346,418,000 m²\nTotal Bangkok Area: ~1,570,000,000 m²\nAccessibility Coverage: 22.06%\nThis indicates that just over one-fifth of the city was within 400 meters of a significant public green space in 2021.\n2025 Analysis: Using the same methodology, the 2025 dataset was filtered and processed. The buffer zone was again limited to 400 meters, dissolved, and clipped to Bangkok’s boundary.\nBuffered Area: 394,777,000 m²\nAccessibility Coverage: 25.14%\nThis shows a modest increase in access, reflecting some progress toward Bangkok’s green space targets.\nConclusion: From 2021 to 2025, the proportion of Bangkok’s land area within 400 meters of large public green spaces increased from 22.06% to 25.14%, reflecting a 3.08 percentage point improvement.\nWhile this growth is positive, it still falls short of the 50% target for universal walkable access to green spaces. This highlights the need for continued investment in park development, better spatial planning, and potentially more equitable green space distribution across the city.\n\n\n3.2.3 Urban Tree Canopy\nTo evaluate changes in visible tree cover across Bangkok from 2021 to 2025, a multi-step remote sensing approach was used:\nSatellite Imagery Selection Copernicus Sentinel-2 Level 2A data was sourced for January–March 2021 and 2025, with cloud cover below 5%.\nNDVI & Band Selection A vegetation density index was created using bands B02, B03, B04, and B08 at 10-meter resolution.\nTree Detection via Classification A Random Forest classification model was trained to detect tree cover specifically, improving differentiation between grass, shrubs, and trees.\nVectorization & Area Calculation The classified raster was vectorized to allow for area-based analysis of greenery.\nUrban Tree Canopy Ratio Tree canopy ratio was calculated using:\nTree Canopy Ratio = Greenery Area / Total Area of Sample Location\nThis was applied to two contrasting urban zones — Chong Nonsi (CBD) and Lat Phrao (Residential) — to compare greenery in dense vs. suburban context\nResults: 2021: 16.6% 2025: 19%\nConclusion: Between 2021 and 2025, Bangkok’s urban tree canopy ratio increased from 16.6% to 19%, indicating a positive trend in visible tree coverage. This growth suggests that efforts to expand urban greenery—whether through tree planting or preserving existing canopy—are beginning to take effect.\nHowever, the relatively small increase (+2.4 percentage points) highlights that progress is gradual and may be uneven across different urban zones. The comparison between Chong Nonsi (CBD) and Lat Phrao (Residential) also reflects the challenge of expanding greenery in high-density areas, where space constraints limit planting opportunities.\nThis suggests that while the city is moving in the right direction, accelerated and location-sensitive greening strategies are still needed to meet long-term urban sustainability goals."

    "text": "Project Motivation\nBangkok, the capital of Thailand, is a major city in Southeast Asia facing rapid urbanization due to its low cost of living and thriving remote working landscape. However, this urbanization has placed pressure on urban amenities, notably the provision of urban greenery.\nIn 2022, Bangkok had just 7sqm of public green space per capita - far lower than the World Health Organization’s recommended minimum of 9sqm per capita, and measly compared to the average of 39spm / capita across 22 other comparable Asian cities in size.\nAs such, to tackle this issue, the Bangkok government proposed the Green Bangkok 2030 Project in 2020, as part of Thailand’s commitment towards the 2015 Paris Agreement. The objective of the project was to increase sustainable, quality green spaces in Bangkok through three targets:\n\nIncreasing the ratio of green space to 10sqm / person\nIncreasing public green space accessible within 400m by no less than 50% of Bangkok’s total area\nIncreasing urban treen canopy per urban area to 30% of Bangkok’s total area.\n\nWith 2025 as the halfway mark, we’ll be using GIS data to identify if there has been progress made towards achieving the Green Bangkok 2030 Project’s targets.\n\nObjectives\nThe objectives of the project is therefore to:\n\nInvestigate the changes in vegetation in the Bangkok metropolitan area between 2021 and 2025.\nAnalyze the types of greenery cover which have been increased or decreased during this time period\nConclude if Bangkok is on track to meeting its targets."

    "text": "Bangkok is one of the fastest-growing cities in Southeast Asia, facing rapid urban expansion, increased infrastructure development, and significant environmental challenges. In response, the Green Bangkok 2030 project was launched to increase green spaces and make the city more livable and sustainable. However, measuring actual progress toward this goal requires objective, data-driven monitoring methods.\nSatellite-based remote sensing offers an efficient and scalable way to monitor changes in land cover over time. By using high-resolution temporal data from 2020 to 2024, this study seeks to assess how Bangkok’s urban landscape is evolving—particularly the extent of green space changes. This work is crucial for supporting evidence-based urban planning and evaluating the effectiveness of greening initiatives."
